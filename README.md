# POO-Practice
This is a practice-test repository where I'm learning POO, Typescript and maybe a new front end and/or back end framework.

## WHAT ARE THE MAIN GOALS?
  - ✅ Be able to build an entire web application using POO.
  - ✅ Make testing units which can be useful for preventing issues.
  - ✅ Make an application which is scalable and could be a real problem solver or real usage tool.


## WHY?
  - Because I'm currently learning POO and would love to share with someone who's in the same position.
  - So that recruiters or colleagues can see what I'm able to do or learn to do as a software developer.
